# Jetpack Compose State

Learn the essentials of one of the pillars of Compose: State & recomposition.

## Can I take this course? 🤔

- Compose Level: Beginner 🟢
- Android Level: Beginner 🟢

## Structure

This course is split in 6 different parts with a mix of slides, videos, and exercises:

- State as a source of truth for our Composables. Recomposition. State hoisting.
- Data stability and smart recomposition.
- Snapshot State as a mechanism to isolate state in concurrent environments.
- State saving and restoration for surviving configuration changes and process death.
- Derived state.
- Integration of Compose State with other data types for representing observable state. E.g: LiveData, Flow, StateFlow, SharedFlow, RxJava’s (2 and 3) Observable, Flowable, Maybe, Completable.

## Price / Duration

This course is designed as a simple to digest collection of self consumable learning pills to make it easier for attendees. The course lasts around 3 hours. My goal is to help you grow a solid mental mapping on how to think about State in Jetpack Compose.

## Sources

When you enroll, you will get the sources with the final solution to all the exercises. You will be able to use it as a reference.
